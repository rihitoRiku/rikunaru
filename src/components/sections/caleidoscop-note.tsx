            to share a little about myself and my dream of becoming a teacher
            and a book writer, creating a cozy safe café for my community
            family. This space also would reflects my philosophical and
            spiritual journey, one that has brought growth, awakening, and
            deeper self-understanding. Here, I’d also love to share the art and
            literature that have inspired and guided me along the way.
